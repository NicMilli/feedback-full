# Feedback app - New MERN version with backend and database to store feedbacks
The frontend of this project is inspired by the course ['React Front to Back 2022'](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/). The design is very stylish and this project was more useful to learn react hooks and component organization. I implemented my knowledge learnt in the support tickets project to add a MERN stack so that feedbacks can be stored in MongoDB database..
